We should note that executing a delete query with @Query works differently from Spring Data JPA's deleteBy name-derived query methods. The latter first fetches the entities from the database, and then deletes them one by one. This means that the life-cycle method @PreRemove will be called on those entities. However, with the former, a single query is executed against the database.
